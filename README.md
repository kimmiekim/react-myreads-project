# react-myreads-project

This is my **first project** for **Udacity React Nanodegree**. 
This project demonstrates my understanding in React fundamentals including state management and UI rendering. 

This app allows users to search books from Udacity's book server and arrange books in their own shelves by selecting whether they have 'read', 'want to read','currently reading' or 'none' options.

In order to view this app in your local computer, open your command line and enter:
```$git clone``` 
```$npm install```
```$npm start````

And voila, you now have your own bookshelf!
Thanks for viewing my app! :D
